Free SMTP Server is a free SMTP server program for Windows that lets you
send email messages directly from your computer. Along with a mass mailer the
program can be used as a relay server for sending newsletters, distributing
messages to different mailing lists, sending notifications to your customers,
as well as for sending personalized messages. You can use it instead of ISP's
SMTP server to increase your privacy. Free SMTP Server supports all
email programs like Outlook Express and Eudora, but best optimized to work with
1st Mass Mailer mass mailer. The email program you already use for sending and
receiving messages can be connected to the server in a very easy way - by using
the word "localhost" instead of your current SMTP host. Having done so, you can
send messages in a usual manner. Free SMTP Server is very fast, while
sending, it establishes dozens of SMTP connections, and gets the most out of
your Internet connection. Free SMTP Server is able to send thousands of
emails per minute with a regular DSL Internet connection. The user interface of
the program is very easy to learn, excellent documentation is included. The
program is freeware so there is no reason not to download and try it!
